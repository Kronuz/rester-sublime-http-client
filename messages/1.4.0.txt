RESTer 1.4.0 Change Log


New Features:

- cURL

    To allow Linux users to make HTTPS requests, I added the ability to use
    cURL in place of the native Python connection. This is an optional feature
    and must be turned on through the settings.

- Redirects

    RESTer can now automatically follow redirects. This can be disabled through
    settings, either entirely, or for specific status codes.

- Sublime Text 2

    RESTer will now work in Sublime Text 2.
