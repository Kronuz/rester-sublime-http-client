RESTer 1.5.0 Change Log


New Features:

- Side-by-side mode

    Responses can now open in a specific group. You can tweak the settings to
    behave how you like, but these settings will work for a standard,
    two-column, side-by-side mode:

    {
        "response_group": 1,
        "response_group_clean": true,
        "request_focus": true
    }

    See the configuration file or README for descriptions of these options.

- Response views now marked as "scratch"

    When a response loads, the view is marked as a "scratch" view to prevent
    Sublime from prompting to save on close. If you work extensively with the
    requested data and want to have this prompt, set "response_scratch" to
    False in the configuration.
