RESTer 1.6.0 Change Log


New Features:

- Multiline Form Field Values

    The support for automatically encoding a request body as a form now allows
    for multiline field values and values with whitespace preserved intact.

    To use this feature, wrap the value in delimiters. By default, the values
    will look like Python-style """triple-quotes strings""", but you can
    customize this by changing the form_field_start and form_field_end
    values in the settings file.

    Here's a sample request using the default delimiters:

        POST http://api.my-example-site.com/cats/
        Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

        name: Molly
        color: Calico
        nickname: Mrs. Puff
        extra: """{
            "id": 2,
            "description": "This JSON snippet is wrapped in delimiters because it has multiple lines."
        }"""
